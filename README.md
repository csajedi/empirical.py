# The universal distribution computational engine

This package provides tools to work on enumerating the universal distribution according to the [work](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.05429.pdf) done by Zenil et al. It might in later versions share many features with [OACC](http://complexitycalculator.com/HowItWorks.html). Overall, we aim to implement the estimation for Definition 7 [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1101.4795.pdf).
