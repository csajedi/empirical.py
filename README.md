# The universal distribution computational engine

This package provides tools to work on enumerating the universal distribution according to the [work](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.05429.pdf) done by Zenil et al. It might in later versions share many features with [OACC](http://complexitycalculator.com/HowItWorks.html).
